1. Interface layout
2.Button workings
3. game system
4. Database

**IMPORTANT**

THIS DOES NOT NEED TO WORK LIKE A REAL RETAIL APPLICATION

Game system example:
10 points for tweet
10 points for viewing event on map
50 points for buying ticket
20 points for completing profile info

Key to keeping twitter credentials lies in accessToken

Enhanced back button functionality:
keep track of "page" variable, home = page 0, menu = page 1
Back button reverts to whatever screen assigned to number - 1


Change geopoint output and popup window

Database stores ---> event info, ticket info, prize info

Information to store:
user

Check for name input on first screen, 140 character limit for tweet (see what happens otherwise)

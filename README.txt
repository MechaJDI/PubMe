This is the source code to my senior project called Publisize Me created for use with a startup company, published to Github with permission.

PublisizeMe was meant to be an Android application that allowed users to both discover events held at various venues near the user and communicate about them by way of social networks. The clients would be incentivized to do so by way of a point earning system for participation which would in turn act as currency for prizes. 

Currently implemented features include:
Ability to post to twitter (need your own app registered on twitter.com to do so)
View events using google maps
Storage of login information

Intended features:
Ability to post to facebook (implementation started on but not completed)
Database storage of events, tickets, and user information (implementation not completed)
Conversion of address to GeoPoint

The project utilizes the following:

Eclipse IDE & Android plugin
Android SDK (target API is Android 2.2)
Google Maps API
Scribe library - https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java
eUML2

Further documentation is found in the doc folder with the index file.
